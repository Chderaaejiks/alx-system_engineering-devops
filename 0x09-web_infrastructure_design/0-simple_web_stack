## Answers:
	1. Server is a computer, that has it's own, hard disk, CPU, RAM. What
        separates server from your computer is that server gives service to
        other computers, whether it is to store files, to use email or to connect
        to web  sites. A server can be of one kind providing one service or it
        can provide all the services mentioned above.

        2. Domain name is a text based name of a webpage and used it is used
        by DNS to match it to its respective IP address.A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a
        series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of
        numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

        3. www.foobar.com, The domain name here is foobar.com that comes after
        the dot and the first part, www, is a subdomain. www is used as a CNAME
        record whose value is foobar.com, which is then used by DNS to find it's
        IP address.

        4. Web server in its hardware form stores the html, java, css, image,
        it also stores web server software. The web server software controls
        how websites are accessed. This is done with the help of HTTP server,
        that understand URL and HTTP requests, to deliver us a static webpage.Web server respond to the client request in either of the following two ways:
        1.Sending the file to the client associated with the requested URL.
        2.Generating response by invoking a script and communicating with database


        5. An Application server is a server program that resides in the server (computer) and
        provides the business logic for the application programme. The server can be a part of the
        network, more precisely the part of the distributed network. The server program is a
        program that provides its services to the client program that resides either in the same
        computer or on another computer connected through the network.Application servers connect database information (usually coming from a database server) and the end-user or client program (often running in a Web browser).


        5. Database is a way to store information in an organized manner so
        that it can be easily accessed, updated and utilized.


        6. The server uses IP address to communicate with the client using
        protocols like TCP\IP, HTTP.

## Issues with the infrastructure:
        1. It has SPOF. 
        This can be with the client software or hardware, the network
        connection or with a single server. It is a single server, malfunction in its
        hardware or software or even issues in the data center can fail the entire system.

        2. Downtime when it is updating requires for the whole system to be
        shutdown, at this time users will not be able to access the services
        because there is no other server that can take its place.

        3. It is using a single server that can be overloaded with incoming
        bulky traffic. This can cause server crashing. There is no scalability
        because we don't have another server.
